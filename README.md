An LSTM-based text generation model using TensorFlow/Keras. The implementation will include:

**Dataset Preprocessing:**

-    Convert Shakespeareâ€™s text to lowercase.
-    Remove punctuation.
-    Tokenize text into sequences of characters.
-    Prepare input-output pairs.

**Model Design:**

-    Use an embedding layer.
-    Add one or more LSTM layers.
-    Include a dense output layer with softmax activation.

**Model Training:**

-    Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
-    Implement early stopping and checkpoints.
-    Train using categorical crossentropy loss and Adam optimizer.

**Text Generation:**

-    Generate text based on a given seed input.
-    Convert generated token indices back into readable text.


The initial implementation of the LSTM-based text generation model is complete. This script:

-    Preprocesses the Shakespeare dataset.
-    Tokenizes and pads text sequences.
-    Builds and trains an LSTM model.
-    Generates text based on a given seed phrase.
